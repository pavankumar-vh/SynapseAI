# Render Keep-Alive Service

This service keeps your Render backend awake by sending periodic health check pings.

## Why?

Render's free tier goes to sleep after 15 minutes of inactivity. This service prevents that by pinging your server every 14 minutes.

## Built-in Keep-Alive

The server now has **automatic keep-alive** in production mode. When deployed to Render, it will ping itself every 14 minutes automatically.

## External Keep-Alive (Optional)

If you want an external service for extra reliability:

### Option 1: Run Locally
```bash
cd server
node keep-alive.js
```

### Option 2: Deploy on Render
1. Create a new **Background Worker** on Render
2. Connect your GitHub repo
3. Set root directory: `server`
4. Set command: `node keep-alive.js`
5. Add environment variable:
   - `RENDER_URL=https://synapseai-7dxo.onrender.com`

### Option 3: Use Cron-Job.org (Free)
1. Go to https://cron-job.org/
2. Create free account
3. Create new cron job:
   - URL: `https://synapseai-7dxo.onrender.com/api/health`
   - Interval: Every 14 minutes
   - Request method: GET

### Option 4: Use UptimeRobot (Free)
1. Go to https://uptimerobot.com/
2. Create free account
3. Add new monitor:
   - Type: HTTP(s)
   - URL: `https://synapseai-7dxo.onrender.com/api/health`
   - Interval: 5 minutes (free tier)

## Recommendation

The **built-in keep-alive** in `server.js` should be sufficient. It runs automatically in production and requires no external setup.
